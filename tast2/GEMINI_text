CSS styles can be applied to HTML elements in three ways:

  Inline CSS: Directly within the HTML element's style attribute.
  Internal CSS: Within a <style> tag in the <head> section.
  External CSS: In a separate .css file linked to the HTML document.

Each method has its advantages and disadvantages:
  
  Inline CSS: Quick and easy for one-off changes but can make code less readable.
  Internal CSS: Improves code organization but is not suitable for large projects.
  External CSS: Best for large projects, separates content from presentation, and allows for reusability.
