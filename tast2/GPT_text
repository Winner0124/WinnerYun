Differences Between Inline, Internal, and External CSS:
Inline CSS:

  Definition: Applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
  Advantages: Quick and useful for small, specific changes.
  Disadvantages: Hard to maintain, not reusable, violates best practices of separating content and style.
  
Internal CSS:

  Definition: CSS is placed within a <style> tag in the <head> of the HTML document.
  Advantages: Suitable for styling unique to one page.
  Disadvantages: Duplication occurs across multiple pages, not ideal for large projects.
  
External CSS:

  Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked via the HTML <link> tag.
  Advantages: Best for large projects, reusable across multiple pages, improves maintainability and performance through caching.
  Disadvantages: Requires an additional file request, styles wonâ€™t apply if the file fails to load.
